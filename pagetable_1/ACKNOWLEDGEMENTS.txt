I called upon many resources when working on this project. First and foremost, several TAs were very helpful in my understanding of what translate() and page_allocate() should be doing at a high level, including Paul, Tavis, and Sara. I used Stack Overflow to determine how to use certain functions such as posix_memalign() and memset(). Lastly, I used Professor Reiss' slides often to supplement what the TAs and Stack Overflow helped me with.
